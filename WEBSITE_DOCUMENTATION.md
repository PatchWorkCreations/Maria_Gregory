### About Section
**Title:** "The Mentor Behind the Mentors"

**Main About Copy:**
"Maria Gregory is the person leaders call when everyone else calls them. A mentor of mentors, she works behind the scenes with founders, executives, coaches, educators, faith leaders, and high-impact professionals — the people who carry others every day.

Her work is less about giving answers and more about helping you hear your own wisdom again. She brings decades of experience in community work, counseling spaces, mentorship, and leadership, combined with a deep belief that the strongest leaders are the ones willing to keep growing."

**I RiseUp Context (shortened, not main headline):**
"Maria has founded and served in multiple initiatives focused on growth, healing, and education — including the I RiseUp group of organizations and community-focused programs for youth. But today, her calling is focused: to walk alongside the people who walk alongside everyone else."

**Core Belief (adjusted to mentorship context):**
*"Every person who holds space for others deserves a safe place to be fully human, messy, honest, and still deeply seen."*

---

### 1:1 Mentorship Section
**Anchor:** #mentorship  
**Title:** 1:1 Mentorship with Maria  
**Subtitle:** A private, steady space for the people who carry everyone else.

**Core Copy:**

**What this space is:**
A confidential, long-term mentoring relationship where you can bring the parts of your leadership that don't fit on LinkedIn — the doubt, the questions, the grief, the wins you can't celebrate publicly, and the decisions that keep you up at night.

**What this space is not:**
A quick-fix coaching program, a hype session, or one more performance space where you have to "be okay."

**Mentorship Pillars (as service cards):**

1. **Clarity & Alignment Sessions**
   - Deep, honest conversations that reconnect you to why you lead and where you're really going.

2. **Emotional & Spiritual Grounding**
   - A space to process what you're holding — emotionally, spiritually, mentally — without needing to be "on."

3. **Relational & Team Dynamics**
   - Guidance and reflection on the relationships you carry: co-founders, teams, family, boards, communities.

4. **Legacy & Transition Work**
   - Support when you're changing seasons, passing the torch, or redefining who you are beyond your role.

**Practical Section:**

**How working together works:**
- Format: 1:1 private mentorship (online or in-person as available)
- Who it's for: Leaders, mentors, coaches, and professionals in any field who hold responsibility for others
- Next step: Fill out the form below and Maria will personally review and respond.

**Implementation Note:** Use ServicesSection + Service models for this. Create one ServicesSection for "1:1 Mentorship with Maria" with the pillars as Service cards.

---

### The Lion You Don't See Section
**Title:** "The Lion You Don't See"

**Content:**
"The Lion You Don't See began as a story, but it's also a mirror. Maria wrote it to remind people — especially those who lead — that strength doesn't always look loud. Sometimes it looks like continuing to show up, even when no one sees the weight you're carrying.

The same lens she used to write this story is the lens she brings into her 1:1 mentorship: helping you notice the quiet, steady lion you've always carried inside."

**Quote:**
> "The lion within you has always been there. My work is simply to help you remember its voice."

**Book:** "The Lion You Don't See" (book cover displayed)

**Content:**
"If you're the one people come to for strength, it can be hard to admit when you need someone too.

Maria offers a small number of 1:1 mentorship spaces each year for leaders, mentors, and professionals who are ready to grow in a deeper, truer way — without losing themselves in the process."

## Current Status

**Note:** The current `home.html` template contains hardcoded content. The website has a database-driven CMS system available, but the template is currently using static HTML content rather than pulling from the database models.

To make the website fully dynamic:
1. Update `home.html` to use Django template variables
2. Populate the database with content via the dashboard
3. The `content_helpers.py` module is ready to provide content from the database
