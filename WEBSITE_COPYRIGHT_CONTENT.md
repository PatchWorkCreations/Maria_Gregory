## Who I Mentor Section

**Title:** Who I Mentor

**Subtitle:** Any profession. One kind of leader.

**Intro Copy:**  
"I don't mentor based on job titles — I mentor based on responsibility.

If people come to you for guidance, decisions, comfort, or clarity… if you're the one others lean on… you're the kind of person I was made to serve."

**Micro Reflection:**  
As you read through these, see where you quietly recognize yourself — even if your official title looks different on paper.

### Role Cards:

**1. Founders & CEOs**  
You're carrying the weight of a vision, a team, and a future — often in silence.

*Question for you: Where do you actually lay that weight down, if at all?*

**2. Coaches, Therapists & Healers**  
You hold space for everyone else's emotions and rarely have a grounded space for your own.

*Question for you: When was the last time you were the one being fully witnessed instead of holding the space?*

**3. Educators & Trainers**  
You shape minds, rooms, and cultures — and sometimes forget you're allowed to be a student too.

*Question for you: Where in your life do you still long to learn and be guided?*

**4. Faith & Community Leaders**  
You serve people in their most vulnerable moments and often feel like you need to stay "strong" no matter what.

*Question for you: What parts of you never get to be tender, tired, or unsure?*

**5. High-Responsibility Professionals**  
You make decisions that affect lives, teams, or systems — and you can't just "turn it off" when the workday ends.

*Question for you: What do you wish you could say out loud about the pressure you're under?*

**6. Mentors & Role Models of All Kinds**  
If people look to you for strength, this space was created with you in mind.

*Question for you: What would it feel like to have someone in your corner the way you are in everyone else's?*

## 1:1 Mentorship Section

**Title:** 1:1 Mentorship with Me

**Subtitle:** A private, steady space for the people who carry everyone else.

### What This Space Is:

"This is a confidential, long-term mentoring relationship where you can bring the parts of your leadership that don't fit on LinkedIn — the doubt, the questions, the grief, the wins you can't celebrate publicly, and the decisions that keep you up at night.

It's a place where you don't have to perform, impress, or hold it all together. You get to be you — fully — and still be deeply respected as the leader you are."

**Reflection Prompt:**  
If you had one conversation this week where you didn't have to be "fine," what would you actually say?

### What This Space Is Not:

"This is not a quick-fix coaching program, a hype session, or one more performance space where you have to 'be okay.'

I'm not here to turn you into a different person. I'm here to walk with you as you become more aligned with who you already are."

**Reflection Prompt:**  
Where in your life are you tired of performing, even if no one knows you're performing?

### Mentorship Pillars:

**1. Clarity & Alignment Sessions**  
We peel back the noise so you can reconnect to why you lead and where you're truly going.

*Question for you: Are you moving toward a life you actually chose — or one that just happened because you kept saying yes?*

**2. Emotional & Spiritual Grounding**  
You get a steady space to process what you're holding — emotionally, spiritually, mentally — without needing to be "on."

*Question for you: Where in your body do you feel the weight of what you carry most days?*

**3. Relational & Team Dynamics**  
We explore the relationships you carry: co-founders, teams, boards, communities, and family — and how to navigate them in a way that feels honest and sustainable.

*Question for you: Which relationship in your life quietly takes the most energy right now?*

**4. Legacy & Transition Work**  
When you're changing seasons, passing the torch, or redefining who you are beyond your title, we walk through that transition together, slowly and intentionally.

*Question for you: If your title disappeared tomorrow, who would you still know yourself to be?*

### Practical Section:

**Intro:**  
"If you're already feeling a small yes — even a quiet, shaky one — this is what it looks like to explore working together:"

**Format:** 1:1 private mentorship (online, with in-person options where possible)

**Who it's for:** Leaders, mentors, coaches, and professionals in any field who hold responsibility for others

**Next Step:**  
"If something here is landing for you, fill out the form below. I personally read every application and will respond with next steps."

## About Section

**Title:** The Mentor Behind the Mentors

**Main About Copy:**  
"I'm the person leaders call when everyone else calls them.

I work quietly behind the scenes with founders, executives, coaches, educators, faith leaders, and high-impact professionals — the people who carry others every single day.

My role isn't to hand you quick answers. My role is to help you hear your own wisdom again. I bring decades of experience in community work, counseling spaces, mentorship, and leadership, along with a deep belief: the strongest leaders are the ones who are still willing to grow."

**Guided Reflection Line:**  
As you read this, you might notice a part of you asking: "Where do I get to be the one who is held, instead of the one who is holding everyone else?" It's okay to let that question linger for a bit.

**I RiseUp Context (shortened, not main headline):**  
"Along the way, I've founded and served in initiatives focused on growth, healing, and education — including the I RiseUp group of organizations and community-focused programs for youth.

Today, my calling is more focused: to walk alongside the people who walk alongside everyone else."

**Core Belief:**  
"If you spend your life holding space for others, you deserve a safe place where you can be fully human — messy, honest, and still deeply seen."

**Optional Prompt below Core Belief:**  
What would 'fully human' look like for you, if you didn't have to manage or impress anyone for a moment?

## Impact Timeline Section

**Title:** Decades of Mentoring in Action

**Intro / Framing Copy:**  
"Long before I ever used language like 'Mentor of Mentors', I simply showed up — listening, serving, and walking alongside people in their real lives.

As you read through these, notice what they stir in you about your own journey of service and leadership."

### Timeline Items:

**1. Presidential Member (2009–2020)**  
American Christian Counselors Association

Years of supporting individuals through challenge, growth, and transformation.

*Reflection: Where have you quietly been holding space for transformation in others?*

**2. Volunteer Big Sister (2004–2016)**  
Big Brothers Big Sisters of America

Over a decade spent empowering youth and helping them see what's possible for their lives.

**3. Judge (2012–2014, 2018)**  
Invention Convention League

Standing with young innovators, encouraging them to trust their creativity and believe in their ideas.

*Reflection: Where are you currently calling out courage and creativity in others?*

**Closing Quote:**  
"This is the ground I stand on when I mentor others — years of quietly showing up, listening deeply, and walking with people through real seasons, not just highlight reels."

## The Lion You Don't See Section

**Title:** The Lion You Don't See

**Content:**  
"I wrote The Lion You Don't See as a story — but it's also a mirror.

It was created to remind you that strength doesn't always look loud. Sometimes, strength looks like the way you keep showing up, even when no one sees the weight you're carrying.

The same lens I used to write this story is the lens I bring into our 1:1 work together: helping you notice the quiet, steady lion you've always carried inside."

**Reflection Prompt:**  
When you strip away everyone's expectations of you, what does your inner lion actually want to say?

**Quote:**  
"The lion within you has always been there. My work is simply to help you remember its voice."

**Book:** "The Lion You Don't See" (book cover displayed)

---

## Personal Roles Section

**Title:** The Human Behind the Mentor

**Subtitle:** The roles that keep me grounded.

**Intro / Framing:**  
"Before I'm anyone's mentor, I'm a human being in real relationships, with real people who see me on my good days and my undone days."

### Role Cards:

**1. Wife**  
I'm building a life of deep partnership and shared purpose.

*Question for you: Where do you feel most deeply partnered in your own life?*

**2. Stepmom**  
I show up with patience, presence, and unconditional love — even on the messy days.

*Question for you: Who in your world sees the soft, imperfect version of you?*

**3. Big Sister & Mentor**  
I've spent years standing beside people who just needed someone in their corner.

*Question for you: Who has stood in your corner — and when was the last time you let them?*

**4. Aunt & Godmother**  
I hold space for the next generation with joy, prayer, and a lot of listening.

*Question for you: What kind of ancestor or example do you secretly hope to be remembered as?*

**Closing Statement:**  
"These roles remind me that every 'leader' is also a human being with a heart, a family, and a story — including you."

## Call to Action Section

**Title:** Ready for Your Own Mentor?

**Content:**  
"If you're the one people come to for strength, it can feel strange — even scary — to admit that you need someone too.

You don't need a crisis to ask for support. You don't have to be 'falling apart' to deserve a space that's just for you.

I offer a small number of 1:1 mentorship spaces each year for leaders, mentors, and professionals who are ready to grow in a deeper, truer way — without losing themselves in the process."

**Reflection Prompt:**  
If nothing was wrong, but things could be more true, more grounded, and more aligned… would that be worth exploring?

**Signature Quote:**  
"You don't have to carry all of this alone. Even the strongest leaders deserve a place to lay it all down."
